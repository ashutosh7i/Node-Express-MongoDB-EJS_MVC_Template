## Usage-
1. server.js is the entry point, also any middleware included in server.js will be availabe to any file in relation.
2. server.js calls Routes/router, it holds all endpoint, when request sent to any endpoint, sends it to specified controller.
3. Controllers/controller handles the request and renders/redirects to specified pages.
4. Views/view hold all pages to be rendered by controller handlers.
5. more info on each page.
